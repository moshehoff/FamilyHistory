## Shimon Meir Hochman

![[bios/I11060285/img_shimon_meir.jpg]]
שמעון מאיר הוכמאן

Born about 1865 in Podolia, Russia, now Ukraine.
d.  2.1.1937   נפטר בשבת, י"ט טבת תרצ"ז                                             
Interred at Nachalat Yehuda, Givatayim

The Karakatta Cemetery records state that Shimon's firstborn son, [Berl](/profiles/Berl-Hochman), died in 1950, aged 65 years. Hence Berl was born in 1884 or 1885. It is thus logical that Shimon was born about 1865. 

**He was the eldest of nine sons of [Wolf Hoffman](/profiles/Wolf-זאב-Hochman) and [Bella Alzofen](/profiles/Beile-ביילא-Hochman).**:

\* with regard to these sons I have no information.
Benjamin may have passed away when fairly young and [Benzion](/profiles/Ben-Benzion-Hoffman) the son of Hersh'l inherited the given name.
They may have had families. When [Devora Haimson](/profiles/Elka-Dora-Devora-Haimson), grand daughter of Joseph, arrived in Melbourne in the 1920's, she reported that the remnant of the family who were still in Russia had all been killed during the terrible pogroms of 1919.

Wolf and Beile lived in Savran, their children were raised there.

Wolf was a timber merchant. He must have died before 1892, because in that year the first of several grandsons bearing his name was born. His grave should be in Savran. Of community property, only the cemetery remains. 

My father [Hymie](/profiles/Hyman-Judah-Hoffman) told me that [Beile](/profiles/Beile-ביילא-Hochman) went to Palestine, and is buried in Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives. הר הזיתים. She could not have travelled before 1910, and she must have passed away at the latest in 1914, because in that year a grand daughter was named after her. I have not found cemetery burial lists from that year. In any case the cemetery was vandalised by Arabs during the period after 1948. 

The name “Hochman” is Yiddish, meaning “tall”.

The name "Alzofen" is far more interesting. Eltzafan אלצפן a Levite, was one of Aaron's cousins (Book of Exodus 6:22 ספר שמות ), who took Aaron's sons Nadav and Avihu for burial. The name is recorded on the marriage certificate of [Jack Hoffman](/profiles/Jack-Hoffman) and Rachel Zeltzer. It is, however, very rare among Jews. I have found only two such families originating in the Russian Empire. One from Latvia; the other, living in the USA came from Dobrosani on the Dneister River. From there it is not far to Savran. That family, who go by the name Alzofon, have written to me. Alzofen and Alzofon may appear to differ from Eltzafan, however they are accurate representations of Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation.

Most of our forebears married into families from neighbouring villages, and I have a list of such unions, with the names of the various villages. Dobrosani is also not far from Charnomin, Ruchele Gillik's birthplace.

[Nate](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman) and [Leah Hoffman](/profiles/Leah-Hoffman-Nate) said that Shimon was an academic and was the head of a university. According to [Peter Hoffman](/profiles/Dr-PETER-%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%A1-HOFFMAN) he was not an academic, though he had certainly had received a thorough Jewish education. He was a tradesman. In those days in Russia there was no opportunity for Jews to receive higher secular education.

Shimon married [Bracha](/profiles/Bracha-Hochman) ברכה (family name unknown) and they had three sons in Savran:
**1st marriage:**

└─ 3. Natri נתן (died young)
```
Natri ?נתן His name was probably Nathan, and not Natri.  He died young, perhaps as an infant and according to naming conventions, one of Hershel's sons was named Nathan.

Both [Berl](/profiles/Berl-Hochman) (Boris) and [Hershel](/profiles/Hershl-Hochman) (Harry) later came to Western Australia .

From [Nate Hoffman](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman)'s notes (Nate is Shimon's grandson living in Perth, Western Australia), we know that Shimon and Bracha fled Russia with [Berl](/profiles/Berl-Hochman), and carrying [Hershel](/profiles/Hershl-Hochman) as a babe-in-arms during the pogroms of Czar Alexander III's time. This must have been in the years 1888-1890 (First Aliya). Bracha died en-route. Shimon and his sons arrived in Ottoman Palestine and lived at Sarafand al-'Amar סרפנד אל עמר in the district of Ramla. This predominantly Arab district corresponds to the Tzerifin צריפין army base, on the right side of the Jaffa–Jerusalem road. Shimon worked in the winery of Baron Edmonde de Rothschild in Rishon leZion.

Prior to Ramla, he may have lived for a short period at Zichron Ya'akov.

Following Bracha's death Shimon married [Frieda](/profiles/Frida-Hochman) Sisselman, daughter of rabbi Ya'akov Zvi Zisselman יעקוב צבי זיסילמאן of Neve Shalom, Jaffa. Ya'akov Zvi, his wife Mina and their seven children left Pinsk in Russia, arrived in Palestine in late 1886, and settled in Jaffa. The first Zisselman - Moshe - and his wife Naomi Chaya זיסל - who were Ya'akov Zvi's g-g-g-grandparents, lived in the town of Karlin, near Pinsk.

Ya'akov Zvi was a prominent rabbi and a friend of Rav Avraham Kuk הרב אברהם יצחק הכהן קוק who was to be the Chief Rabbi of Palestine. Rav Kuk performed the marriage ceremony of [Hershl](/profiles/Hershl-Hochman) and [Ruchele](/profiles/Ruchel-Hoffman). The marriage certificate כתובה is proudly displayed on the wall in [Nate Hoffman](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman)'s sitting room. 

**The children of rabbi Zisselman were all born in Poland or Russia:**
