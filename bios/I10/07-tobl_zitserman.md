## Tobl Titserman

   Tubb’l was one of six children of Aaron and Elke Zitserman of Bershad.  Her name Tubb’l is the Yiddish diminutive for a dove. She also lived through the pogroms, and

her childhood was  very hard. At the age of nine years she worked with her sisters as a seamstress. Bershad was a centre of woollen tallith (prayer shawl) weaving.  She learned tallith making too and later in Perth she tailored tallitot for her family and grandchildren.

       Aaron died sometime before 1912, as Harry Aaron received his name. 

The family name Zitserman (or Zaitserman) is derived from the Yiddish root “zits”

 “to sit”. A zaitser is a rabbinical court judge, or dayan; as he is one who sits in judgement on a panel, or on a bench in a court.

 According to Leah Dzienciol his son Yakov was a dayan in Bershad.                          

                      The children of Aaron and Elke were: 

•                     Arcadia   (a daughter).

•                     Frida          m. Pesach

•                     Tubb’l        m. Moshe Hochman                      יונה    

•                     Basya  or Pessy     m. Pinchas Shwartz                          בתיה

•                     Mariam     m. Moshe Greenberg                  מרים

        and Yaakov Z  (birth order not known)        יעקב

     I haven't found any period photos of Bershad. During the Second War it became an internment camp for Jews from the surroundings and from Moldava.  Apart from a synagogue, all communal property was destroyed. The appended photos of the extant synagogue are from about 2006.
