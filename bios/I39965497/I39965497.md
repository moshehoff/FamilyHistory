_From Mal Hoffman’s research (in 2005) SAVRAN ODES’KA, UKRAINE (Lat 48 degrees 08’ N Long 30 degrees 06’ E). Located approximately 50km NE of Balta and 100km from border of Moldova._

Harry was the second son born to [Shimon](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-מאיר-Hochman) and [Bracha](/profiles/Bracha-Hochman).

From Nate Hoffman’s notes:
Harry’s parents fled Russia (as did Rachel’s) carrying Harry as a babe in arms during the Pogroms of the Czars time (Alexander III 1881 – 1894 or Nicholas II 1894 – 1917)

_Pogram: Russian term, originally meaning ‘riot’ that came to be applied to a series of violent attacks on Jews in Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Pogroms were few before the assassination of Alexander II in 1881; after that, with the connivance of, or at least without hindrance from, the government, there were many pogroms throughout Russia. Soldiers and police often looked on without interfering. These pogroms encouraged the first emigration of Russian Jews to the United States. After 1882 there were few pogroms until 1903, when there was an extremely violent three-day pogrom at Chisinau resulting in the death of 45 Jews. Although it has not been conclusively proved that the Czarist government organised pogroms, the government’s anti-Semitic policies certainly encouraged them. After the abortive revolution of 1905, pogroms increased in number and violence. With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution, pogroms ceased in the Soviet Union; they were revived in Germany and Poland after Adolf Hilter attained power._

_See E.H. Judge, Easter in Kishinev: Anatomy of a Pogrom (1992) – Mal Hoffman._

They were taken to Rishon Le Zion. Both families dwelt there and raised their families.

**_Rishon Le Zain:_** _The fourth largest city in Palestine and 10 kilometers south and east of Tel Aviv Rishon Le Tzion, or the first of Zion, was founded in 1882 by a group of Russian settlers, and is credited with being the first modern agricultural settlement in Palestine (now known as Israel), hence the name._

Harry's mother died when he was young. He had two siblings – Natri and [Berl](/profiles/Berl-Hochman).

Following [Bracha](/profiles/Bracha-Hochman)'s death, [Shimon](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-מאיר-Hochman) married [Frieda](/profiles/Frida-Hochman) Sisselman and they had five more children. (information received from [Nate Hoffman](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman))

From [Nate](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman)'s notes Apparently [Frieda](/profiles/Frida-Hochman) didn't like Harry and he ran away from home when he was about 11 years old. [Shimon](/profiles/Shimon-Meir-מאיר-Hochman) used some influence to get him a job working for a German engineering company that produced pumps and engines for wells. Harry trained as a fitter and turner.

He met the red-headed [Rachel](/profiles/Ruchel-Hoffman) (Roochle/Rachelle) Gilik (Hilik) who had also been carried out of Russia as a babe in arms and the couple were married 18th April, 1908 in Jaffa, Palestine.

From information given by [Nate Hoffman](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman) during a conversation with Mal, Terry and [Marie Hoffman](/profiles/Marie-Hoffman) in 2005, In 1914 the family moved to Egypt where Harry looked after an olive crushing plant (which could also grind wheat into flour).

[Rachel](/profiles/Ruchel-Hoffman) did not like Egypt as the food market stalls were run by Arabs and hence food preparation was not "kosher" – a basic Jewish requirement.

Harry and Rachel had six children:

Harry was a fitter and turner and worked on various jobs around the Perth area.

Among his possessions are references from :

Atlas Engineering Company Fremantle dated 7th March 1916. Harry had been employed by them for six months as a fitter and turner.

George Kent Ltd Railway Parade West Perth dated 18th September 1917 where he was employed from 13th March 1916 to 5th August 1917 as a fitter and turner.

Eilbeck Holding Pty Ltd, 2-20 John Street, Perth WA dated 20th December 1963 accepting with regret the retirement from the company after 46 years of continuous and meritorious service.

[Nate Hoffman](/profiles/Nate-Hoffman), Harry's third son who was born in Perth, wrote in his notes that  his father "was a brilliant engineer (Fitter and Turner) eventually becoming foreman of Eilbecks Engineering Works in West Perth where he worked for 43 years. They were the largest manufacturers of timber milling saws, nail making and woodworking machines in Western Australia. During Harry's time there he worked on various projects including Government House Perth Gates or doors.  The nails were handmade.

A further interesting comment from Mal Hoffman:

“The ticket for the ship’s passage from Port Said to Fremantle in May 1915 was issued for Mr and Mrs Hochman plus 1 child 6 and 1 child 3.

Hochman became Hoffman,

Boruch became [Bruce](/profiles/Bruce-Boruch-Hoffman), Bentson became [Benjamin](/profiles/Ben-Benzion-Hoffman) (which are the names shown on their death certificates)

The father Herchel became Harry (which is shown on his death certificate).

We’ll never know if this was a deliberate decision of Harry and Rachel to Anglicise their names to become more easily accepted in an ‘Énglish’ country or whether the clerk handling their immigration formalities (who may not have been a scholarly type) just wrote down the closest phonetic spelling he could get to what they said.

I have no record of dad ever being referred to as Bentson in Australia."
