## HYAM YUDL HOCHMAN Introduction

This is the story of Hyam Yudl Hochman and his family's arrival and establishment in Australia during the period 1901-1920. Hyam was the pioneer who led the way for his brothers and nephews to follow, creating opportunities and partnerships that would shape their futures in Western Australia.

The narrative covers the first twenty years of the Hoffman family history in Australia, from Hyam's arrival in February 1901 through the establishment of all family members as independent businessmen by 1920. It traces their journey from fruit vendors to wine merchants and publicans, documenting their struggles, successes, and the mutual assistance that characterized this generation of immigrants.

## Historical Context

The story begins with Hyam's background in Russia and Palestine, his membership in the early Zionist movement Hovevei Zion (חובבי ציון), and his purchase of land in Rehovot from Yehoshua Hankin. After working at the Mikve Yisrael agricultural school near Jaffa, difficult conditions in Palestine led the family to seek their fortune in Western Australia.

This history is intimately connected with the development of the Jewish community in Perth and the goldfields, and the critical role Jewish fruiterers played in bringing fresh produce and preventing scurvy and other diseases in the harsh Australian outback.
